---------------------------------------------------

1. 📚 Directory Structure and Organization:

- Assignment:
  ✓ Reinforced my understanding of core concepts.
  ✓ Helped me apply theory to real code problems.

- Mini Project:
  ✓ Built a Student Report Card Generator — tied together file handling, type casting, conditionals.

- Notes:
  ✓ Provided quick-reference summaries of foundational topics.

- Sample Code:
  ✓ Improved my coding style and efficiency through examples.

---------------------------------------------------

2. 🧠 Key Learnings:

- File Handling:
  ✓ Learned how to use fopen(), fprintf(), fclose() to write to files.

- String Manipulation:
  ✓ Used fgets() to capture full names.
  ✓ Used strcpy() to assign strings safely.

- Conditional Logic:
  ✓ Implemented nested if-else conditions to handle grading and remarks.

- Type Casting:
  ✓ Used (float) casting to avoid integer division errors in percentage calculation.

---------------------------------------------------

3. ⚠️ Challenges and Fixes:

- scanf() vs fgets():
  ✗ fgets() captured leftover newline from scanf().
  ✓ Fixed by adding getchar() before fgets().

- String assignment to arrays:
  ✗ grade = "A+" didn’t work.
  ✓ Fixed by using strcpy(grade, "A+").

- File not found:
  ✗ Didn’t see report.txt after running.
  ✓ Understood it saves in the current directory unless given a path.

---------------------------------------------------

4. 🚀 Enhancements and Future Plans:

- Multiple student support using loops and structs.

- Save report as separate files like report_105.txt using sprintf().

- Add colored terminal output using ANSI escape codes.

- Add visual bar graphs for subject performance.

---------------------------------------------------

🧠 Summary:

This section helped build a strong foundation for writing clean and structured C code for embedded systems. It taught me how to work with inputs, outputs, strings, and files — and prepared me to build larger, modular projects.
