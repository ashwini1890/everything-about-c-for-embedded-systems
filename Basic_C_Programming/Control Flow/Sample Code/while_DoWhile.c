/*
ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement: Number Guessing Game with Replay Option

Create a number guessing game in C where:

    The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.

    The user has to guess the number.

    After each guess, the program tells the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

    The user keeps guessing until the correct number is guessed â€” use a while loop for this.

    After the game ends, the user is asked if they want to play again â€” use a do-while loop to allow replaying the game.
