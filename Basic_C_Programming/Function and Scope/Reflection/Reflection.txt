📘 Reflection on the Topic: Control Flow in C Programming
🔍 What I Learned:
While studying the topic of control flow in C programming, I gained a deep understanding of how a program's logic can be guided using various decision-making and looping constructs. I explored key control flow statements such as:
    • Conditional statements (if, if-else, nested if, and switch)
    • Looping constructs (for, while, and do-while)
    • Jump statements (break, continue, and goto)
Each construct plays a vital role in solving real-world problems through logic and flow control.

🧠 Key Insights:
    • Conditional Statements allow a program to make decisions. For example, I used nested if-else to determine a student’s grade based on their average marks.
    • The switch-case structure simplified menu-driven programs and improved readability, especially in options-based systems like the student report management project.
    • Loops are powerful in automation. I practiced using:
        ◦ for loops for fixed iterations (e.g., entering subject marks),
        ◦ while loops for input validation,
        ◦ and do-while loops for repeating menus.
    • The use of break and continue helped in managing loop execution more precisely, making my programs more efficient and user-friendly.
    • Although goto is generally discouraged in modern programming, I learned how and when it can be safely used for basic error handling or retrying operations.

💻 Application in Project:
I applied all these control flow concepts in a mini project — Student Report Management System — which:
    • Allowed users to enter and validate student data,
    • Used loops and conditions to calculate total, average, and grade,
    • Displayed data in a formatted table,
    • Saved the report to a file,
    • Provided a menu-based interface using a switch-case structure.
This helped me connect theory with practical coding and improved my logical thinking.

🎯 Personal Takeaway:
Studying control flow strengthened my foundation in C programming. It taught me how to plan the logical structure of a program, respond to user input, and make decisions dynamically. These skills are essential not only for basic programs but also for advanced application development in embedded systems, automation, and real-time software.
I now feel more confident in writing structured, clean, and interactive C programs by utilizing control flow effectively.
